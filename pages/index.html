                    I know that the first year of college brings a lot of fun, excitement and some challenges.  And believe me, I am speaking from experience, it takes some time to adjust to your new student life.
                    And at some point, everything can get messy and you find yourself planning to drop out of school. At least that was what happened to me.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But this moment is also when other students in your project group, upper-class students and oslomet instructors come to you and help you overcome obstacles and challenges.

              <h2>How do we learn at OsloMet?</h2>
                  <p>
                    Education here is relatively relaxed and not time consuming. We don't have long and intense lectures confusing you with tons of useless information. Instead we have projects which make you get your hands dirty and learn by trying.

                Accessibility is concerned with whether all users are able to access an equivalent user experience, whenever they encounter 
                a product or service. Accessible design and inclusive design work hand in hand to lower barriers that exclude people 
                from using digital products effectively.
                </p>
                <p>                    
                Addressing accessibility, usability, and inclusion together can effectively lead to a more universally designed Web for everyone.
                Unlike usability and inclusive design, accessibility focuses especially on people with disabilities that affect access to the Web, including; 
                auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, visual. Changing the mindset from “designing for me” to “designing for all” is 
                a considerable undertaking but it will benefit both the users and the product in great deal.

                <p>
                When we design accessibility in mind we should prioritize simplicity and perceivability 
                in every step to ensure that it does not exclude users who have different abilities or interact with their devices 
                in different ways. Well-designed websites can be responsive to a user’s device as well as to a user’s needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                Accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for ex. people using devices with small screens,
                people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm or broken glasses, 
                people with “situational limitations” such as in bright sunlight,
                or people who have limited or expensive bandwidth which causes slow Internet.
               </p> 
                <h2>
                During this project our team has applied accessibility features as much as we can to the site.
                In order to achieve this, we have actively:
                </h2>

                <ul class="accessibility-ul">
                    <li>Used semantic HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible such as <code>button</code>, <code>picture</code>, <code>span</code>, <code>alt</code> etc.</li>
                    <li>Incorporated most of the Principles of Universal Design such as equitable, 
                    flexible, simple, and intuitive use with low physical effort</li>
                    <li>Chosen web safe fonts to make sure that they are generally available across all systems. Eg. In this project we have used Helvetica (sans-serif).</li>
                    <li>Improved visibility with careful color selection and high contrast </li>
                    <li>Made content easily understandable – simpler language reaches more users
                    <li>Used the decision tree on how to use the <code>alt</code> attribute on content-enhancing images </li>  
                    <li>Used keyboard access to all functionality</li>
                    <li>Validated markup using the W3 standards site to ensure all browsers can read our code </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Our validation results:</h2>

                    <ol>
                        <li> <em>Welcome (index) page: H4 followed H1, and was changed to H2. No other accessability errors. </em> Summary and ScrShot </li>
                        <li> <em>Reflection page:</em> No accessability errors were found using the test. HTML showed several errors, which were corrected for the final version.
                            Summary and ScrShot </li>
                        <li> <em>Accessibility page:</em> Accessability: Some bold tags (&lt;b&gt;) were used, 
                            and they were replaced with emphasis tags (&lt;em&gt;). An id was repeated twice, changed to class. After this, there were no more accessability faults. Summary and ScrShot </li>
                        <li> <em>Topical information page:</em> Accessability test showed no known or likely problems. The HTML-checker showed some erors, mostly
                            backslash being used for paths and some CSS elements being in the text. This was fixed, and the resulting test showed no errors.</li>
                        <li> <em>Fun page:</em> Summary and ScrShot </li>
                        <li> <em>CSS:</em> There were 2 problems and 2 warnings for the validation. The 2 problems were redundant code which was removed, and 
                        also made us look closer for other redundant code. One of the warnings showed a value being deprecated. To avoid problems for spesific users, 
                        chagned this to the following code: <q>overflow-wrap: anywhere;</q>. The other warning showed the following error:
                        <q>-webkit-font-smoothing is a vendor extension</q>. We found that the code would only work for spesific users.
                        Due to the minor differences with or without this code, we decided to remove it. 
                        See the picture bellow for a screenshot of the validation errors.</li>
                    </ol>

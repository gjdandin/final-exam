                Accessibility is concerned with whether all users are able to access an equivalent user experience, whenever they encounter 
                a product or service. Accessible design and inclusive design work hand in hand to lower barriers that exclude people 
                from using digital products effectively.
                </p>
                <p>                    
                Addressing accessibility, usability, and inclusion together can effectively lead to a more universally designed Web for everyone.
                Unlike usability and inclusive design, accessibility focuses especially on people with disabilities that affect access to the Web, including; 
                auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, visual. Changing the mindset from “designing for me” to “designing for all” is 
                a considerable undertaking but it will benefit both the users and the product in great deal.

                <p>
                When we design accessibility in mind we should prioritize simplicity and perceivability 
                in every step to ensure that it does not exclude users who have different abilities or interact with their devices 
                in different ways. Well-designed websites can be responsive to a user’s device as well as to a user’s needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                Accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for ex. people using devices with small screens,
                people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm or broken glasses, 
                people with “situational limitations” such as in bright sunlight,
                or people who have limited or expensive bandwidth which causes slow Internet.
               </p> 
                <h2>
                During this project our team has applied accessibility features as much as we can to the site.
                In order to achieve this, we have actively:
                </h2>

                <ul id="accessibility-ul">
                    <li>Used semantic HTML elements for their intended purpose as much as possible such as <code>button</code>, <code>picture</code>, <code>span</code>, <code>alt</code> etc.</li>
                    <li>Incorporated most of the Principles of Universal Design such as equitable, 
                    flexible, simple, and intuitive use with low physical effort</li>
                    <li>Chosen web safe fonts to make sure that they are generally available across all systems. Eg. In this project we have used Helvetica (sans-serif).</li>
                    <li>Improved visibility with careful color selection and high contrast </li>
                    <li>Made content easily understandable – simpler language reaches more users
                    <li>Used the decision tree on how to use the <code>alt</code> attribute on content-enhancing images </li>  
                    <li>Used keyboard access to all functionality</li>
                    <li>Validated markup using the W3 standards site to ensure all browsers can read our code </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Our validation results:</h2>

                        <li> <b>Topical information page:</b> Accessability test showed no known or likely problems. The HTML-checker showed some errors, mostly
                            backslash being used for paths and some CSS elements being in the text. This was fixes, and the resulting test showed no errors.</li>

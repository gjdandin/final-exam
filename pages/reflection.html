                <p>For us new students, starting at OsloMet and familiarizing ourselves to the campus took a while to get used to. 
                    Campus is located in the middle of the city with lots of traffic and consists of many different buildings that can be hard to find and navigate around.
                    Some of us have even experienced a sort of culture-shock when transitioning from going to our local high-school to OsloMet campus.
                </p>
                <p> However, after this transition period, many of us have learned to enjoy the campus environment that OsloMet provides with its many amenities nearby.
                    We have tried the famous Bislett kebab, and eaten authentic japanese food at nearby Kanpai sushi. 
                    Some of our fellow students have even gotten tattoos and piercings done right beside campus with Timeless tattoo shop nearby. 
                    We have even had the opportunity to live and party right beside campus in Pilestredet park studenthus, and strolled around beautiful Pilestredet park with friends. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, having so many cool places near campus has also been a double-edged sword. 
                    It can be easy to get distracted and forget that OsloMet is supposed to be a place of learning, especially for us new students who may not have acquired healthy study habits just yet.
                </p>
                <p>To summarize, OsloMet is a campus environment that is very stimulating to students with its location being in the middle of the city, and because of that, us students can find it hard to focus and prioritize study.</p>

                    For students new and experienced alike, it can be hard to get used to working with other students.
                    In our experiences in most universities and highschools, the focus is on individual learning and completing exams on our own. However, this is often not the case at OsloMet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For us aspiring software engineers/computer scientists, many of our courses encourage us to work with others and submit group assignments together. 
                    This has been a difficult adjustment for some of us who like to work alone and conflicts have arisen between students with differing workloads and work ethics. 
                    We can also feel burdened by group members who communicate badly and at the worst case, can have freeloaders in the group who do not contribute.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, on the bright side, group projects provided us a realistic simulation on how people actually work and collaborate in a work environment.
                    Alongside giving us students the opportunity to make professional connections, network with course peers and perhaps even make life-long friends along the way.
                    This has given us students valuable experiences and lessons on group work that we can bring with us to our future employment.

                    Programming is not an easy skill to learn for most people. It demands of the learner to acquire a programmers mindset -
                    a logical way of thinking that forces the programmer to compartmentalize the code into smaller parts in their head and to be able to handle many different levels of abstractions at once.
                    Certain personality traits such as persistence, adaptive thinking and the ability to think outside the box are arguably also traits that good programmers should have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For new programming students, this "programmer" way of thinking can be difficult to learn. 
                    At the start of the semester, we as new compsci students may know nothing at all about coding and in the span of a few weeks become suddenly thrust into the world of variables,
                    IDE's and runtime errors. 
                    Learning to program has been a frustrating and confusing process for most of us. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the semester went on, some of our fellow students have found it difficult to adapt to a programmers mindset and find passion in coding, and moved on to other courses.
                    However, for those of us who persevered, we have found enjoyment (and perhaps even passion) in creating functioning programs and fixing bugs.
                </p>
                <p>Few things can surpass the feeling of relief when a program finally works after hours of bug-fixing and thinking of solutions. 
                    We have embraced the learning process, both the bad and good, and can call ourselves real programmers now. </p>

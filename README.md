## Brainstorming, ideate, thoughts:
- We may reuse the design of pancake house (if appropriate), but different colors, font etc. to make it a little bit different.
- We may create somethig with OsloMet colour scheme = yellow + black + white + some other strong colours such as dodger blue, tomato, magenta etc.
- We shall create proper text and content for every page as much as we can.
- We shall create an impressive entrace to the site , easy and userfriendly
- Accessibility page is perhaps the most important one by content, it should be excellent!
## PAGES: 
* __(Ahmet) Welcome! (index.html)__: this page should be a general information page  that helps the visitor understand what this site is, and navigate to the  other pages. May be short and simple. Common theme for site: Being a  first-year student (at OsloMet). 

* __(Gilhan) Reflection-essay__: This page must contain a short text (500-700 words) describing the challenges experienced by the (one, several or all)  members of the group when transitioning from upper-secondary school  (or work-life) to university. Reflect on any of the following topics: a) learning to code, or 
b) being a student rather than a pupil, or 
c) managing the workload. 
Please illustrate with screenshots of code or illustrating images if you  can. Else, we recommend using images of OsloMet to create a mix of  headings, paragraphs, and images for this page. We shall not assess the  language/grammar of the paragraphs. We expect headings, text and  images that relate to each other (content). Headings should be  informative and grammatically correct (proper visual hierarchy). 

* __(Sirin) Accessibility page__: It must contain a short presentation of accessibility (up to 500 words describing how the group tested the code for  accessibility using an automated test. Also explain how you checked,  validated, and made coding-choices for universal design beyond what an  automated test can do. You are welcome to use screenshots from the  testing site and of your code. We shall read this text! While the content of  your page is but a minor part of the assessment, this is the text that we  are certain to read. (Grammar not important.) 

* __(Johan) Topical information page__: Technology and society (with external links): Write – or re-use a short text you have previously written – (anywhere  from 300 to 1000 words) about technology and society. You are allowed  to reuse text from "DATA1100 Technology and Society for Programmers"  or other subjects. This text should have multiple links to external sites  with relevant information. We shall not grade you on how relevant the  information you link to is, but we expect several links and we expect it to  be easy to understand before clicking what information you lead us to. 

* __(Bhira) Fun page__: Make one page that is in a different layout and have a  different styling than the others. Put in some text and images. We accept  place-holder text, but don’t use copyrighted images. Or you can present  an activity or a place in Oslo. This page is an opportunity to be creative  and shine. You may embed video or sound, but again: beware of  copyright, please! Don’t forget to consider the size of the media files  (videos or pictures).

## Delivery checkpoints:
* 1- Design&create mock-ups: the website shall have a holistic (complete website) feel and look.
* 2- Implementation:
* 3- Testing and validation: accessibility...
## How we shall grade these final assignments (from the assignment text):
* __Structure and navigation, wide screen and small screens__: Are the pages  well structured (with headings, paragraphs, images) and is it easy to  navigate between the pages? We shall check this on different screens. 
* __Accessibility and legibility__: We shall look both at the automated test and  use our experience to assess how well designed the pages are. (The  «Fun page!» Is not part of "Accessibility"-assessment.) Your description  will assist us in understanding the choices you have made. 
* __Ease of maintenance__: Is the code easy to maintain for a new developer?  Can someone else take over your work and modify, change, and further  develop this site using their IDE of choice (rather than the one you  used)? We shall look at the code itself. Is it well-structured and easy to  read? Are you following conventions for comments? Is the CSS well  organised with each element styled only once (if possible)? Is the  structural code (like boxes) separate from code that define the visuals?  Et cetera. 
* __The text "Short presentation of accessibility". Have you done an automated test? Were you able to comprehend the results? Have you  reflected on accessibility beyond automated tests? And does the entire  site appear coherent, as a site of pages, rather than fragmented texts  without a common theme?__
* We accept reuse of code from you obligatory assignments.
